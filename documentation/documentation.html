	<title>MTDb - Ultimate Movie&TV Database</title>
 	<meta name="description" content="Thank you for purchasing MTDb! This app is built on top of laravel framework which means it is 100% OOP oriented, follows MVC pattern and best coding practises. Great, why do I care you ask? Well, because of all the above, besides this documentation you have a massive amount of online documentation for laravel which you almost always can apply to this app. So if you want to do some advanced modification/extension to MTDb, or just want to understand better how it works under the hood, take a look at Laravel Docs, Laracasts, or just google for dozens of other tutorial/help sites on laravel.">

                        <h2>Creating a new database</h2>
                        <p>First thing you want to do before installing <strong>MTDb</strong> is to create a new database on your mysql server. If you already know how to do this/or have already created one just skip to the next step.</p> 
                        <p>Your host will most likely be running <strong>phpMyAdmin</strong> as mysql manager, if that's the case here's a step by step guide (if not the proccess will be very similar on other managers).</p>
                        <p>Login to your control panel, find and click phpMyAdmin link: <img src="assets/images/db_ex_2.png"> Click on the database tab in the top menu, enter any name you like and click create.<img src="assets/images/db_ex_3.png"></p>

                        <h2>Uploading Files</h2>
                        <p>After creating a database, unzpip the file you donwloaded and upload the <strong>contents</strong> of <strong>mtdb</strong> folder to your server root (usually called www or html or something similar), shared hosting providers usually have a web based file manager, but you should use something like <a href="https://filezilla-project.org/">Filezilla</a> to do the upload as the web based managers cause various problems fairly often.<br><br>
                        <strong>IMPORTANT! Make sure that .htaccess file got copied properly from the download to main mtdb folder on your server.</strong>

                        	<li>2. If you have made any translations, open up <strong>app/lang/en/main.php</strong> and <strong>app/lang/en/dash.php</strong> and copy the language lines marked with latest version to language files on your server, and then delete the <strong>app/lang folder</strong> from the download folder. If you didn't make any translations you can skip this step.</li>
                        	<li>3. Upload and overwrite the rest of the files same way you did when you installed MTDb.</li>
                            <li>4. Visit <strong>http://yoururl.com/update</strong> to finish updating. (might not always need to do this step)</li>
